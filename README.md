  Infinity For Reddit Fork Fork</a>
</h1>

*(There have been multiple reports of Reddit banning users of the app)*

## ⚠️ Warning

Asking users to input their credentials directly in the app is a big **security risk**. As a user you are also **violating the Reddit User Agreement**.

I implore everyone who uses this fork and similar projects to look at the commits yourself and ensure that the credentials are not being stolen. 

## Changes

This Fork enables a user to login via the official Reddit Accounts endpoint (no 3P authorize). The App will make requests that look like they are coming from the official Reddit App.

### TODO (First Party Features)

See upstream: https://github.com/KhoalaS/Infinity-For-Reddit#todo-first-party-features

### External Media

-   External videos like _REDGifs/Imgur_ will be loaded from the Reddit servers and not through an external API if possible.
-   You will be able to see the content of broken links, if they were mirrored to Reddit's servers before breaking.
-   This only works in the Subreddit, User, Search and Home Feeds. Support for Popular/All will be on hold, to not break compatibility.
-   Might break if the GQL API changes
-   old Gfycat links might not work
