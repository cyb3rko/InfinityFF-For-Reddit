  Infinity For Reddit Fork </a>
  
</h1>

## Changes

This Fork enables a user to login via the official Reddit Accounts endpoint (no 3P authorize). The App will make requests that look like they are coming from the official Reddit App.

## ⚠️ Warning

Asking users to input their credentials directly in the app is a big **security risk**. As a user you are also **violating the Reddit User Agreement**.

I implore everyone who uses this fork and similar projects to look at the commits yourself and ensure that the credentials are not being stolen.

The releases are automated.

## Want to input your own Client-ID?

Check out the [Sub-Branch](https://github.com/KhoalaS/Infinity-For-Reddit/tree/sub). You will be prompted to enter a Client-ID during login. The User-Agent will be determined by the two additional inputs, App name and Username.

## TODO (First Party Features)

I was originally looking into using the Sendbird SDK for chats, but recently Reddit changed their chat backend. They are now using [Matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2).

-   [ ] Chat
-   [x] Inline Subreddit Emotes and Gifs in Comments
-   [x] use GQL API for Home posts
-   [x] use GQL API for Subreddit/User/Search posts
  -   [x] use the 1P Reddit DASH streams for external videos, i.e. REDGifs will load without a REDGifs API-Key.
  -   [x] fix video downloads missing audio
-   [ ] update to new federated GQL API
-   [ ] Giphy SDK
  -   [x] integrate SDK
  -   [ ] use comment endpoint to post with RichtextJSON
  -   [ ] Gif Preview in Comment

---

#### External Videos

-   External videos like _REDGifs/Imgur_ will be loaded from the Reddit servers and not through an external API if possible.
-   You will be able to see the content of broken links, if they were mirrored to Reddit's servers before breaking.
-   This only works in the Subreddit,User,Search and Home Feeds. Support for Popular/All will be on hold, to not break compatibility.
-   Might break if the GQL API changes
-   old Gfycat links might not work 

#### Issues with multiple Accounts
If you previously had problems using multiple accounts, this update fixes this. Please log out of all accounts and login again for the changes to take effect.

#### Issues getting logged out
If you previously had problems where you seem to have been logged out (posts on home and popular are the same), the newest update should fix that.
