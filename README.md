  Infinity For Reddit Fork </a>
  
</h1>

## Changes

This Fork enables a user to login via the official Reddit Accounts endpoint (no 3P authorize). The App will make requests that look like they are coming from the official Reddit App. 

## ⚠️ Warning

Asking users to input their credentials directly in the app is a big __security risk__. 

I implore everyone who uses this fork and similar projects to look at the commits yourself and reassure that the credentials are not being stolen.

## Want to input your own Client-ID?

Check out the [Sub-Branch](https://github.com/KhoalaS/Infinity-For-Reddit/tree/sub). You will be prompted to enter a Client-ID during login. It is using
a dummy User-Agent for the tim being. You might want to change that to something more descriptive.

## TODO (First Party Features)

- [ ] Chat
- [ ] Inline Subreddit Emotes, (needs some richtext parser, SpannableString stuff)
